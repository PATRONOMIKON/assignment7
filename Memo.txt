A tree is an appropriate structure for the doctor management system because it naturally represents hierarchical relationships.
In a hospital, doctors report to other doctors in a chain of command, which mirrors a parent–child structure.
Using a binary tree allows each doctor to have up to two direct reports, making it easy to model leadership relationships and traverse them in meaningful ways.

Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals each serve different real-world purposes.
Preorder traversal is useful when a supervisor should be processed before their team, such as when sending top-down announcements or assigning tasks starting from leadership.
Inorder traversal is helpful when processing nodes in a left-to-right logical order, which could be useful for structured reviews or audits. 
Postorder traversal is useful when subordinates must be handled before a manager, such as when collecting reports or deallocating resources.

Heaps are ideal for simulating real-time systems like emergency intake because they efficiently maintain priority order.
A min-heap ensures that the patient with the lowest urgency score is always at the root and can be accessed in constant time.
Insertions and removals run in O(log n), which makes the system fast even with many incoming patients.
This reflects real hospital workflows where urgent cases must always be handled first without scanning the entire list of patients.

Together, these data structures demonstrate how choosing the right structure leads to efficient, real-world solutions.
